[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Having worked as a Software Engineer for four years, I have realized that the growth in the size of an application or system is proportionate to the scope of a business over time. However, this growth often presents challenges of scalability, efficiency, and privacy, thus deciding the solvency of a business. Therefore, with a motivation to enhance my knowledge in distributed systems and lead teams in the industry to develop more scalable and efficient systems, I am pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science at Arizona State University. This degree would provide me with a robust platform for advancing my knowledge and augment my ability to develop scalable applications.\nI completed my B.Tech. in Computer Science \u0026amp; Engineering from Vellore Institute of Technology in 2018. After this, I joined MiQ Digital as a Software Engineer. I managed to drive many critical projects to completion, which helped me become one of the youngest Senior Software Engineer there. I was endowed with multiple awards for showcasing our company values.\nSome of my passions include Microservices, Distributed Systems, Big Data, REST, CI/CD, and HA/DR Services. I have also been a passionate open-source contributor, having majorly contributed to the project Spring Cloud Dataflow. I also author Tech Blogs to share my learnings with a wider audience.\n  Download my resumé.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"Having worked as a Software Engineer for four years, I have realized that the growth in the size of an application or system is proportionate to the scope of a business over time.","tags":null,"title":"Siddhant Sorann","type":"authors"}]
