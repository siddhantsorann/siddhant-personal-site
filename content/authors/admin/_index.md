Hello! I'm Siddhant, a dedicated software engineer actively seeking new opportunities in software engineering roles. I have a Master’s degree in Computer Science (4.0 GPA) and over four years of rich experience in the tech industry, particularly in the Programmatic Ad-Tech sector. My journey in software engineering is underpinned by a proven track record of leading innovative projects that significantly enhancing operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

My passion for software engineering is driven by the endless possibilities it presents in solving complex problems, improving business operations, and unlocking new opportunities. From a young age, I've been captivated by how technology can turn imaginative ideas into tangible solutions that not only propel efficiency and innovation but also have a meaningful impact on people and businesses.

A key career highlight for me was leading a team to dramatically reduce advertisement campaign processing times from 60 minutes to 1 minute by deploying a distributed system with Kafka, Spring Boot and Kubernetes. This achievement, recognized with the MiQ Impact Award, demonstrated my ability to deliver innovative solutions that resonate with clients and stakeholders. My professional ethos extends beyond the confines of daily tasks. I have been recognized as the Employee of the Year at MIQ for consistently embodying the company's core values. Furthermore, my engagement with the community through open-source contributions, authoring [tech blogs](https://medium.com/@siddhant_47693), and receiving commendable recommendations on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/siddhant-sorann/) from managers and peers mirror my commitment to fostering innovation and leadership within the tech landscape.
