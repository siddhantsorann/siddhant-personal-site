Hello! I'm Siddhant, a dedicated software engineer actively seeking new opportunities in software engineering roles. With a Master’s degree in Computer Science (4.0 GPA) and over four years of rich experience in the tech industry, particularly in the Programmatic Ad-Tech sector. My journey in software engineering is underpinned by a robust command over technologies such as Java, Spring Boot, Python, Ruby, SQL, ReactJS, Docker, Kubernetes and more, alongside a proven track record of leading innovative projects that significantly enhance operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

One of my career highlights includes leading a pivotal project that dramatically reduced data processing times for ad campaigns from 60 minutes to just 1 minute. This achievement, which was facilitated by implementing a distributed system and a pub-sub model with Kafka and Kubernetes, not only earned me the MiQ Impact Award but also underscored my capacity to deliver innovative solutions that resonate with clients and stakeholders.

My professional ethos extends beyond the confines of daily tasks. I have been recognized as the Employee of the Year at MIQ for consistently embodying the company's core values. Furthermore, my engagement with the community through open-source contributions, authoring [tech blogs](https://medium.com/@siddhant_47693), and receiving commendable recommendations on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/siddhant-sorann/) from managers and peers mirror my commitment to fostering innovation and leadership within the tech landscape.

My passion for software engineering is driven by the endless possibilities it presents in solving complex problems, improving business operations, and unlocking new opportunities. From a young age, I've been captivated by how technology can turn imaginative ideas into tangible solutions that not only propel efficiency and innovation but also have a meaningful impact on people and businesses.
