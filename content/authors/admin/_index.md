Having worked as a Software Engineer for four years, I have realized that the growth in the size of an application or system is proportionate to the scope of a business over time. However, this growth often presents challenges of scalability, efficiency, and privacy, thus deciding the solvency of a business. Therefore, with a motivation to enhance my knowledge in distributed systems and lead teams in the industry to develop more scalable and efficient systems, I am pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science at Arizona State University. This degree would provide me with a robust platform for advancing my knowledge and augment my ability to develop scalable applications.

I completed my B.Tech. in Computer Science & Engineering from Vellore Institute of Technology in 2018. After this, I joined MiQ Digital as a Software Engineer. I managed to drive many critical projects to completion, which helped me become one of the youngest Senior Software Engineer there. I was endowed with multiple awards for showcasing our company values.

Some of my passions include Microservices, Distributed Systems, Big Data, REST, CI/CD, and HA/DR Services. I have also been a passionate open-source contributor, having majorly contributed to the project [Spring Cloud Dataflow](https://dataflow.spring.io/). I also author [Tech Blogs](https://medium.com/@siddhant_47693) to share my learnings with a wider audience.
